#JavaScript-DOM

## DOM: This stands for document object model, and is basically a structured representation of html document.
It can be a tree of nodes/elements created by the browser. And javascript can be used to manipulate the DOM and its elements.

## DOM also means that each object has its properties and methods that we can change and remove things from.
